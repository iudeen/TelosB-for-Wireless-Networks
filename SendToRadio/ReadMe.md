Edit and update the SendToRadiomodule to add the
following features:
1. Add and wire a LedsCcomponent
2. Turn on the Green ledeach time a mote sent messages
3. Implement the Receiveevent to show when a node
receive a message, it will turn on its Yellow led.
4. Add new item called nodeidin the SendToRadioMsgstruct.
Send this nodeidinfo during each transmission.
Program your motes in such a way that if a mote received
a message not meant for him, turn on the Red led.
5. Demonstrate multicastingby programming your mote
to send to a group of motes (recipients). Assume the
group members are all nodes of your colleaguesâ€™ motes
(you need to know their nodeidin this case). Demo your
multicasting concept using ledsin the implementation.
